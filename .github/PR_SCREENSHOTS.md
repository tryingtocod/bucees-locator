Suggested screenshots to add to the PR (place images under `.github/screenshots/` and reference them in PR description):

- `screenshot-header.png` — header and controls visible
- `screenshot-search.png` — filtered results and results badge
- `screenshot-cluster.png` — several clustered markers
- `screenshot-locate.png` — result of pressing the locate button

If you want, I can add sample screenshots: I can capture images here if you authorize a GitHub token (to open the PR automatically and attach images), or you can add your own screenshots in a follow-up commit and I will attach them to the PR description.
